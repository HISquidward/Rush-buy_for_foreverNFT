HTTP is changing under our feet. HTTP/1.1, our old friend, is being
supplemented by the brand new HTTP/2 standard. HTTP/2 provides many benefits:
improved speed, lower bandwidth usage, better connection management, and more.

``hyper`` provides these benefits to your Python code. How? Like this::

    from hyper import HTTPConnection

    conn = HTTPConnection('http2bin.org:443')
    conn.request('GET', '/get')
    resp = conn.get_response()

    print(resp.read())

Simple.

Caveat Emptor!
==============

Please be warned: ``hyper`` is in a very early alpha. You *will* encounter bugs
when using it. In addition, there are very many rough edges. With that said,
please try it out in your applications: I need your feedback to fix the bugs
and file down the rough edges.

Versions
========

``hyper`` supports the final draft of the HTTP/2 specification: additionally,
it provides support for drafts 14, 15, and 16 of the HTTP/2 specification. It
also supports the final draft of the HPACK specification.

Compatibility
=============

``hyper`` is intended to be a drop-in replacement for ``http.client``, with a
similar API. However, ``hyper`` intentionally does not name its classes the
same way ``http.client`` does. This is because most servers do not support
HTTP/2 at this time: I don't want you accidentally using ``hyper`` when you
wanted ``http.client``.

Release History
===============

v0.7.0 (2016-09-27)
-------------------

*Major Changes*

- Added a ``ping`` method, allowing the user to use the HTTP/2 ``PING`` frame
  to check connection liveness before, instead of, or between issuing requests.

*Bugfixes*

- Don't send WINDOWUPDATE frames on closed streams.
- Clean up the outstanding stream reads on stream close.
- Ensured that connection state is always unconditionally reset on stream
  close, regardless of whether the connection has a socket object open or not.

0.6.2 (2016-06-13)
------------------

*Bugfixes*

- Fixed packaging error made in prior release.

0.6.1 (2016-06-13)
------------------

*Bugfixes*

- Tolerate errors when attempting to send a RST_STREAM frame.
- Ensure that calls to ``fileno()`` on the compatibility ``SSLSocket`` object
  actually work correctly. Thanks to @benlast!
- Improved some problems with thread-safety in the ``Stream`` class. Thanks to
  @fredthomsen!
- Allowed for systems to use hyper without the bundled cert file being present.
  Thanks to @JasonGowthorpe!

0.6.0 (2016-05-06)
------------------

*Major Changes*

- The ``HTTP20Connection`` object is now thread-safe, so long as stream IDs are
  used on all method calls.
- Replaced the HTTP/2 state machine logic entirely to use hyper-h2. This will
  dramatically change the behaviour of the library in many situations, mostly
  for the better. However, this is also likely to introduce new bugs, so please
  be cautious.

*API Changes*

- Allow non-dictionary headers in ``request``.
- ``HTTP20Connection`` now has a ``force_proto`` keyword argument to allow the
  ``HTTP20Connection`` to ignore the NPN/ALPN result.
- The ``--h2`` CLI flag now ignores the result of NPN/ALPN negotiation when
  hitting HTTPS URLs.
- Added support for HTTPS client certificates.
- Notifications about streams being reset is now delayed to fire when the
  stream in question is next accessed, rather than immediately.

*Bugfixes*

- Overriding HTTP/2 special headers no longer leads to ill-formed header blocks
  with special headers at the end.
- Vastly improved IPv6 support.
- Fix converting unicode bodies to bytestrings on Python 2.7.
- Allow overriding the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers from the CLI.
- Fixed problems with incorrectly generating the ``HTTP2-Settings`` header.
- Improved handling of socket errors.

0.5.0 (2015-10-11)
------------------

*Feature Enhancement*

- Pay attention to max frame length changes from remote peers. Thanks to
  @jdecuyper!

*Bugfixes*

- Prevent hyper from emitting oversized frames. Thanks to @jdecuyper!
- Prevent hyper from emitting RST_STREAM frames whenever it finishes consuming
  a stream.
- Prevent hyper from emitting lots of RST_STREAM frames.
- Hyper CLI tool now correctly uses TLS for any ``https``-schemed URL.
- Hyper CLI tool no longer attempts to decode bytes, instead writing them
  straight to the terminal.
- Added new ``--h2`` flag to the Hyper CLI tool, which allows straight HTTP/2
  in plaintext, rather than attempting to upgrade from HTTP/1.1.
- Allow arguments and keyword arguments in abstract version of
  ``get_response``.

*Software Updates*

- Updated hyperframe to version 2.1.0

0.4.0 (2015-06-21)
------------------

*New Features*

- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 abstraction layer. Don't specify what version you want to
  use, just automatically get the best version the server supports!
- Support for upgrading plaintext HTTP/1.1 to plaintext HTTP/2, with thanks to
  @fredthomsen! (`Issue #28`_)
- ``HTTP11Connection`` and ``HTTPConnection`` objects are now both context
  managers.
- Added support for ALPN negotiation when using PyOpenSSL. (`Issue #31`_)
- Added support for user-provided SSLContext objects, with thanks to
  @jdecuyper! (`Issue #8`_)
- Better support for HTTP/2 error codes, with thanks to @jdecuyper!
  (`Issue #119`_)
- More gracefully close connections, with thanks to @jdecuyper! (`Issue #15`_)

*Structural Changes*

- The framing and HPACK layers were stripped out into their own libraries.

*Bugfixes*

- Properly verify hostnames when using PyOpenSSL.

.. _Issue #119: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/119

0.3.1 (2015-04-03)
------------------

*Bugfixes*

- Fix blocking ``ImportError``. (`Issue #114`_)

.. _Issue #114: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/114

0.3.0 (2015-04-03)
------------------

*New Features*

- HTTP/1.1 support! See the documentation for more. (`Issue #75`_)
- Implementation of a ``HTTPHeaderMap`` data structure that provides dictionary
  style lookups while retaining all the semantic information of HTTP headers.

*Major Changes*

- Various changes in the HTTP/2 APIs:

  - The ``getheader``, ``getheaders``, ``gettrailer``, and ``gettrailers``
    methods on the response object have been removed, replaced instead with
    simple ``.headers`` and ``.trailers`` properties that contain
    ``HTTPHeaderMap`` structures.
  - Headers and trailers are now bytestrings, rather than unicode strings.
  - An ``iter_chunked()`` method was added to response objects that allows
    iterating over data in units of individual data frames.
  - Changed the name of ``getresponse()`` to ``get_response()``, because
    ``getresponse()`` was a terrible name forced upon me by httplib.

.. _Issue #75: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/75

0.2.2 (2015-04-03)
------------------

*Bugfixes*

- Hyper now correctly handles 'never indexed' header fields. (`Issue #110`_)

.. _Issue #110: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/110

0.2.1 (2015-03-29)
------------------

*New Features*

- There is now a `hyper` command-line client that supports making HTTP/2
  requests directly from the command-line.

*Major Changes*

- Support for the final drafts of HTTP/2 and HPACK. Updated to offer the 'h2'
  ALPN token.

*Minor Changes*

- We not only remove the Connection header but all headers it refers to.

0.2.0 (2015-02-07)
------------------

*Major Changes*

- Python 2.7.9 is now fully supported.

0.1.2 (2015-02-07)
------------------

*Minor Changes*

- We now remove the ``Connection`` header if it's given to us, as that header
  is not valid in HTTP/2.

*Bugfixes*

- Adds workaround for HTTPie to make our responses look more like urllib3
  responses.

0.1.1 (2015-02-06)
------------------

*Minor Changes*

- Support for HTTP/2 draft 15, and 16. No drop of support for draft 14.
- Updated bundled certificate file.

*Bugfixes*

- Fixed ``AttributeError`` being raised when a PING frame was received, thanks
  to @t2y. (`Issue #79`_)
- Fixed bug where large frames could be incorrectly truncated by the buffered
  socket implementation, thanks to @t2y. (`Issue #80`_)

.. _Issue #79: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/79
.. _Issue #80: https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/80

0.1.0 (2014-08-16)
------------------

*Regressions and Known Bugs*

- Support for Python 3.3 has been temporarily dropped due to features missing
  from the Python 3.3 ``ssl`` module. PyOpenSSL has been identified as a
  replacement, but until NPN support is merged it cannot be used. Python 3.3
  support *will* be re-added when a suitable release of PyOpenSSL is shipped.
- Technically this release also includes support for PyPy and Python 2.7. That
  support is also blocked behind a suitable PyOpenSSL release.

For more information on these regressions, please see `Issue #37`_.

*Major Changes*

- Support for HPACK draft 9.
- Support for HTTP/2 draft 14.
- Support for Sever Push, thanks to @alekstorm. (`Issue #40`_)
- Use a buffered socket to avoid unnecessary syscalls. (`Issue #56`_)
- If `nghttp2`_ is present, use its HPACK encoder for improved speed and
  compression efficiency. (`Issue #60`_)
- Add ``HTTP20Response.gettrailer()`` and ``HTTP20Response.gettrailers()``,
  supporting downloading and examining HTTP trailers. (Discussed in part in
  `Issue #71`_.)

*Bugfixes*

- ``HTTP20Response`` objects are context managers. (`Issue #24`_)
- Pluggable window managers are now correctly informed about the document size.
  (`Issue #26`_)
- Header blocks can no longer be corrupted if read in a different order to the
  one in which they were sent. (`Issue #39`_)
- Default window manager is now smarter about sending WINDOWUPDATE frames.
  (`Issue #41`_ and `Issue #52`_)
- Fixed inverted window sizes. (`Issue #27`_)
- Correct reply to PING frames. (`Issue #48`_)
- Made the wheel universal, befitting a pure-Python package. (`Issue #46`_)
- HPACK encoder correctly encodes header sets with duplicate headers.
  (`Issue #50`_)

0.0.4 (2014-03-08)
------------------

- Add logic for pluggable objects to manage the flow-control window for both
  connections and streams.
- Raise new ``HPACKDecodingError`` when we're unable to validly map a
  Huffman-encoded string.
- Correctly respect the HPACK EOS character.

0.0.3 (2014-02-26)
------------------

- Use bundled SSL certificates in addition to the OS ones, which have limited
  platform availability. (`Issue #9`_)
- Connection objects reset to their basic state when they're closed, enabling
  them to be reused. Note that they may not be reused if exceptions are thrown
  when they're in use: you must open a new connection in that situation.
- Connection objects are now context managers. (`Issue #13`_)
- The ``HTTP20Adapter`` correctly reuses connections.
- Stop sending WINDOWUPDATE frames with a zero-size window increment.
- Provide basic functionality for gracelessly closing streams.
- Exhausted streams are now disposed of. (`Issue #14`_)
